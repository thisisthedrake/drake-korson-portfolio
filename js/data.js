      role: "3D Designer & Fabrication Lead",
      overview: "Antrum needed a big presence to showcase their centralized sensing tech—and it had to be modular enough to reconfigure for future shows. I took the concept design, detailed out how it would be built and assembled, and created a full 3D model. From there, I built a clear set of install instructions so the team could break it down, ship it, and set it up again without needing me onsite.",
      research: "I dug into past booth setups, product demos, and the typical flow of foot traffic at AHR. I also reviewed materials and hardware that could survive shipping and reassembly. The goal was to make something clean, durable, and dead simple to install with minimal tools.",
      process: "Starting from a rough concept, I modeled the entire booth in 3D, breaking it down into repeatable, modular components. Every piece was designed with transport, assembly, and scalability in mind. I documented the whole system with step-by-step visuals, labels, and callouts so any install crew could follow along without a walkthrough. I also helped manage the fabrication side, making sure what was built matched what was modeled.",    
      solution: "We ended up with a lightweight, modular booth that could flex to different layouts but still feel like a polished, permanent space. Integrated screens and demo zones let Antrum show off their real-time data feeds, and the material palette balanced their tech identity with a clean, architectural feel.",
      results: [
        "Booth used at multiple expos with minimal refitting",
        "Install guide allowed remote teams to assemble without assistance",
        "Positive feedback from Antrum’s internal team and attendees",
        "Helped showcase product demos effectively and drove booth engagement"
      ],
      reflection: "This build was a perfect mix of design and execution. I love working on projects where I get to touch both the creative and the physical side—thinking through how something looks, works, ships, and survives real-world use.",

      role: "Visual Designer & Technical Fabricator",
      overview: "For the Weathering Emotions exhibit, I was tasked with designing and building a large-scale interactive cloud that could visually represent different emotional states using light. The goal was to create something playful and calming, while also durable enough for a high-traffic children’s space.",
      research: "I collaborated with the museum team to understand the emotional learning goals of the exhibit. I also looked at existing interactive art installations and LED diffusion techniques to ensure the cloud would be both visually effective and safe for kids to engage with up close.",
      process: "I started by designing the overall form of the cloud and planning out how internal LED lighting could shift color and intensity to reflect different emotional states. I engineered the internal structure, programmed the LED behavior using Arduino, and built out a wiring plan that museum staff could maintain long-term. I also helped select materials that diffused light well while still holding up to wear.",
